## Team organisation and work on a challenge
The [data challenges](./challenges.html) have been written in a way to be solvable by capable teams of around 2-6 members.
The number of the team members as well as their email addresses are asked on the sign up form. The teams may change or
add members at any point before or during the challenge, and the written submission should have the names of all the
contributing team members. It's required to keep the challenge organisers up-to-date on the possible changes of the
team leader, so that we always know how to contact the team.

The signed up teams start working on their chosen challenge from 1 September and send a written submission of their
results by the 31 September. The organisers and the challenge partners evaluate the submissions and choose the finalist teams
for each of the challenge for the final oral presentation round in the Inspire Helsinki 2019 event. At least one member of each
team has to be prepared to present their results in the Inspire Helsinki 2019 event either in person or remotely.

The challenge organisers and partners will be available in [Spectrum discussion forum](https://spectrum.chat/inspire-helsinki)
to answer any of your questions considering the data challenges. All the teams are also encouraged to join the
discussions to share ideas and learn together.

## Awards for the best teams
One member of each winner team is awarded with a free entry and limited travel expenses to the INSPIRE 2020 Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia,
and a change to present the final work in the conference.
There may also be more prices awarded for the top ranked teams, more details will be announced later.
