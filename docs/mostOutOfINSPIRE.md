## Background & context

The pan-European INSPIRE infrastructure provides a steadily growing number of datasets for reuse. Despite the good progress made, some technical challenges pertaining to the way in which data are being encoded and served often make it difficult for users to consume, and developers to build value-added applications. The INSPIRE Maintenance and Implementation group addresses those through dedicated actions. Among those, the most important within the context of this challenge are:
- [Alternative encodings for INSPIRE data](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/2017.2)
- [Improved client support for INSPIRE data](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/caniuse)
- [Improved usability of INSPIRE data](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/Action+2019.2%3A+Improving+accessibility+of+data+sets+through+network+services)

This challenge addresses directly outstanding issues of the current INSPIRE infrastructure.

## Summary
This challenge targets the improved exploitation of the INSPIRE infrastructure by limiting possible inefficiencies in the way in which data are being (i) encoded and/or (ii) exposed through network services by EU Member State data providers. The starting point for the work shall be a particular use case and limitations encountered (e.g. building a cross-border dataset, or using a specific dataset in a particular software product), instead of general issues. The following step-wise approach is envisaged:

- **Step 1.** Teams identify and describe a concrete use case for which INSPIRE data is needed (e.g. for creating a cross-border, or pan-European dataset, some analysis, a value-added service/application)
- **Step 2.** Teams look for data, relevant to the use case in the [European INSPIRE Geoportal](http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/). If the providers of dataset(s) to be used are not part of the team, access to the source data shall be negotiated and all licensing and access conditions respected.
- **Step 3.** A particular issue/inefficiency preventing the utilisation of the data is encountered.
- **Step 4.** A mock-up solution is built that (i) creates a layer on top of the existing service/dataset, or (ii) is developed from scratch, i.e. where no previous solution exists
- **Step 5.** The process and lessons learned from the implementation of Step 4 (above) are documented in a lightweight mode
- **Step 6.** Teams present the results at [Inspire Helsinki 2019](https://www.inspire-helsinki-2019.fi/)

## Key issues or questions to answer/investigate

- Lack of client support for complex data structures/encodings
- Granularity of datasets that makes them difficult to utilize
- Difficulties in subsetting datasets through industry-standard query mechanisms

## Required knowledge and skills

- Experience in INSPIRE, OGC standards, (geo)data management and network services
- Good command of tools for utilisation and exposure of geospatial data

## Offered datasets

- Datasets made available through the pan-European [INSPIRE Geoportal](http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/)
- We envisage that the starting points of the work are network services and/or existing data instances where certain inefficiencies are discovered. One (or ideally several) INSPIRE datasets should be used.
- Two approaches are possible: (i) a layer is established on top of existing endpoints/repositories/databases, (ii) a completely new solution is built for the source data.

## Other relevant datasets
- The use of more than one data source in e.g. a cross-border context is encouraged. In addition, participants are welcome to combine INSPIRE datasets with other data sources.
- The teams addressing the challenge are free to choose datasets, but they should always respect licensing and access conditions.
- The challenge organisers can help teams negotiate data access with data providers.

## New technologies to test or evaluate
- Implementations of new API-based standards such as the [Web Feature Service 3.0](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES) and the [SensorThings API](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sensorthings)
- The [INSPIRE UML-to-GeoJSON encoding rule](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/2017.2/blob/master/GeoJSON/geojson-encoding-rule.md)
- Data encoding standards such as the [GeoJSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946) and [OGC GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/)
- The use of innovative technologies is welcome but not mandatory!

## Offered or suggested tools

- [European INSPIRE Geoportal](http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/)
- [Alternative encodings for INSPIRE data](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/2017.2)
- [OSGeo Software tools](https://www.osgeo.org/)

## Desired outcome and presentation

We would welcome the following results:

1. Prototype solution that illustrates how the delivery and consumption of INSPIRE data might be streamlined/facilitated.
2. Lightweight document of the overall process, issues that are encountered, overall feedback on the usability of INSPIRE resources related to the addressed use case, and the lessons learnt. GitHub might be used in order to share those findings.
3. Flash presentation summarising the above two (maximum 5 min.)

## Offered benefits for the teams
- Business opportunities (e.g. evolution of the results into products/services for European data providers)
- Learning experiences (lessons learnt from the work on the challenge reusable for 'real-world' use cases)
- INSPIRE Good practice (possible submission of the results as an [INSPIRE Good practice](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/portfolio/good-practice-library))
- Free registration and follow-up at the INSPIRE Conference 2020 in Dubrovnik for one member of the winning team.

## Submitting organisations
- European Commission, Joint Research Centre
