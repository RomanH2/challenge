  id: commuting20
  summary: "Quality of life is affected greatly by our usual day to day activities and how we commute to and from our place of work plays a big part. Fortunately, this chore has been made very easy by routing apps that use data and routing algorithms to tell us how to get from A to B. However, especially for bicycles, pedestrians, and other light traffic, there is a dimension overlooked by routing applications: conditions and weather. There is a wide array of observation and forecast data about our environment that can be used to provide a great service to commuters."

  summary: "Develop solutions to identify the best location for a seaside vacation! Itâ€™s important to remember that vacationers want different things: some might want clear waters to dive while others want conditions suitable for ice fishing. In contrast, nobody wants to be around oil spills or illegal sewage dumps. Also, the planned vacation activities must themselves follow sustainable and responsible principles regarding the environment."
