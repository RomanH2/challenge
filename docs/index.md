# Inspire Helsinki 2019 Data Challenge

The Helsinki 2019 INSPIRE event is organizing data challenges for practical uses of spatial data in the domains of sea, weather and built environment. With the recent evolution of spatial data delivery technologies like WFS 3.0, vector tiles and simpler data formats for INSPIRE, the geospatial field is reaching out to a wider audience of developers to enrich applications and processes with spatial data.

The challenges are not limited to INSPIRE datasets, your team is free to use any data relevant to the challenges. Teams will produce applications, proofs of concepts, visualizations, presentations, demos over September and will present their results in October at the INSPIRE event in Helsinki. During the challenge month, the event organizers and challenge partners will support you, help provide data, tools and services to ensure successful results.

Stay tuned, more information coming soon!
