## Challenge partners
Finnish Meteorological Institute, Vaisala and Spatineo: Roope Tervo (FMI), Jani Kettunen (Vaisala), Ilkka Rinne (Spatineo)

## Background & context
* This challenge is about helping urban living by using data on weather conditions
* Parts of the weather information are INSPIRE data
* Vaisala has participated in Junction 2018 with the theme ["Actually Useful Weather"](https://www.vaisala.com/en/blog/2019-02/winners-vaisalas-challenges-junction-2018-hacked-weather-and-sauna)

## Key issues or questions to answer/investigate

We are looking for teams to produce prototype routing applications that, broadly speaking, make use of "comfort" as a factor in the routing equation.

* How can data be used to assess the comfort level of a path?
* How can comfortable environment-friendly commuting be increased?
* How to assess safety and conditions of paths using data?
* How can the comfort/safety data be best used to help commuters?
* Can these methods be applied to help someone who wants exercise instead of comfort

## Required knowledge and skills

* Experience with routing algorithms and software
* Software development skills necessary to modify/augment the routing software
* Practical experience of commuting with bicycles will probably help you

## Offered datasets
* Forecast data on current and future weather (FMI)
* Current and historical data on measured weather (FMI)
* HSY air quality sensor data (Vaisala)

The weather datasets are available at [FMI WFS3 beta service](http://beta.fmi.fi/data/3/wfs/sofp). The data from FMI is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data-licence)

## Other relevant datasets

* OSM or other base map for urban routing
* Elevation models (National Land Survey of Finland)
* HSL Developer Community

## New technologies to test or evaluate

* Core data is delivered through an experimental [WFS 3.0 server](https://github.com/vaisala-oss/sofp-core)
* Data is in a new JSON data model specifically for observations and measurements [OMSF](https://github.com/opengeospatial/omsf-profile)

Note. WFS 3.0 implementation list is available in the [WFS/FES Github repository](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/blob/master/implementations.md)

## Offered or suggested tools

* Open source routing software

## Desired outcome and presentation

* Online demo or proof-of-concept software delivered through a web application is preferred
* Ideas relevant for the challenge that was not implemented due to time constraints or technical issues should be included in a presentation
* Comments on the data encoding (OMSF) and delivery method (WFS 3)

## Offered benefits for the teams
* Unknown at the time, will provide information later
